# What have I learnt ?
I have learned a lot about the basics of p5js, such as setting a canvas, background, stroke colour/weight, shapes, rotations, simple movements,
how to change where something will appear on the canvas and how to use different objects together.

## How Have I Learnt this ?
The p5js website was very helpful for figuring out which parameters decided the shapes values, a few things I found especially useful were:

### Cylinder Info 2, https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/cylinder

### Ellipsoid Info, https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipsoid  
![Ellipsoid info](https://github.com/TherealJC/Lab-3/blob/p_five_develop/src/Ellipsoid.png)

## Why have I learnt this ?
Because it is a course requirement, I dont think it will be very useful for what I want to do in the future, but I will do my best to take away as much knowledge as I can from this course regardless.

## What Do I know that I didnt before ?
p5,js basics such as canvas, draw, functions used, 2d and 3d shapes, that the p5.js extension is not very good, a lot of working code doesnt show up in there, it is easier to use the live server/port as that seems to work a lot better.

## What is the point ?
It is a course requirement, and it is useful to know how coding can be used to create these functions and graphics.

## What are real life applications ?
Graphic design, web design, web development, any app or game development.

## What will I do to fill in gaps in my understanding ?
I will also use the internet to fill in gaps in my knowledge, and hopefully attending class provides some new knowledge.

## Conclusion
This week there was a lot of new things to learn, it was good because it was not that difficult. The most difficult part is just following the labs instructions correctly, like i've just had to move the journal from the p_five_develop branch to the master branch because I saw that it is meant to be on master AFTER the fact.
The p5.js basics are relatively easy to understand, but there are a lot of moving parts and new built in keywords that I must learn, Although I am not looking forward to it (coding is always very difficult for me in the beginning), I will do my best. Basic coding knowledge WILL be useful for my future, but more so in c++ and java, however, it all relates, and this will be a good stepping stone.
